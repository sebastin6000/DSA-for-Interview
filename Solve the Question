Here's a versatile template for solving any Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem.
You can follow this structured approach to break down and solve a problem methodically:

DSA Problem-Solving Template.

Understanding --> Imformation Extracting --> Thinking Solution --> Thinking into Code Comverting.

1.Understanding: Understand the Problem Statement
  - What is being asked?: Carefully read the description to identify the problem's objective.

2.Imformation Extracting:
  - Input data type - with this we can know about the function arguments.
  - Expected Output with return type - Understand what output is expected with this we understand what to return from the function.
  - Time complexity expectations if any.
  - Understand the Constraints - with this we can understand how much is the Input size that helps to thing how big the input

3.Thinking Solution.
  -Identification Part: Identify the Type of Problem - Recognize patterns
      - Searching (binary search, linear search)
      - Sorting (quick sort, merge sort)
      - Greedy algorithms (minimizing/maximizing)
      - Dynamic programming (overlapping subproblems, memoization)
      - Graph problems (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
      - Recursion or backtracking (divide and conquer)
  - Destructure the given problem statement into simple words to get intution for conversional solution.
  - After Finding out Solution in conversional manner and than breaking the conversional solution into smaller subtask.
  - Complete all the smaller subtask and Combine all of them into solution.

4.Thinking into Code Converting Part
  - Choose the Right Data Structures.
  - Design the Algorithm with respect to Edge Cases
     - Consider cases where the input is
       - Empty arrays, lists, or strings.
       - Arrays with only one element.
       - Arrays where no solution exists.
       - Negative numbers, zeros, very large or very small numbers.
       - Explicitly test and handle these cases in your solution.
         The above are some example

    - Convert the smaller Subproblems into code.
    - Combine all the smaller Subproblems code for the Complete Solution.

1. Understand the Problem Statement
Read the problem carefully:What is being asked?: Carefully read the description to identify the problem's objective.

2. Extract Key Information
Identify the input data type and output format (e.g., array, list, string, number).
Note the constraints:Input size (e.g., n, the array size).
Time complexity expectations (e.g., O(n), O(log n), etc.).
Understand what output is expected: Indices, values, Boolean results, etc.

3. Identify the Type of Problem
Recognize patterns:
Searching (binary search, linear search)
Sorting (quick sort, merge sort)
Greedy algorithms (minimizing/maximizing)
Dynamic programming (overlapping subproblems, memoization)
Graph problems (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
Recursion or backtracking (divide and conquer)

What technique or data structure can help?
Arrays, Linked Lists, HashMaps, Heaps, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.

4. Consider the Constraints
Time Complexity:
What’s the maximum input size?
What algorithm is best suited to the constraints?
If n is large, avoid brute force O(n^2) approaches, look for O(n) or O(log n) solutions.
Space Complexity: Are you using extra space (hash maps, recursion stack)? Consider memory usage.

5. Break the Problem into Smaller Subproblems
Divide the problem into subtasks or steps.
Example:
If the problem requires sorting and then finding a pair, break it down into a sorting step and a pair search step.
Think about intermediate results or reusable parts (subproblems or overlapping subproblems).

6. Handle Edge Cases
Consider cases where the input is:Empty arrays, lists, or strings.
Arrays with only one element.
Arrays where no solution exists.
Negative numbers, zeros, very large or very small numbers.
Explicitly test and handle these cases in your solution.

7. Choose the Right Data Structures
Selecting data structures that help solve the problem efficiently:HashMap/Set: For fast lookups or checking uniqueness.
Array/Linked List: For sequential access and modification.
Stack/Queue: For problems involving order (LIFO/FIFO).
Heap: For problems that require finding the min/max efficiently.
Graph: For traversals, shortest path, or connectivity problems.
Tree: For hierarchical data storage and operations like search.

8. Design the Algorithm
Outline the algorithm step-by-step:Input processing (parsing, conversion).
Main logic (looping, recursive calls, applying a specific algorithm).
Final output.
Write the algorithm in pseudocode before jumping to code:Write it in simple,
natural language or basic syntax that represents your thought process.

9. Write the Code
Code iteratively: Start with the basic structure, then fill in details as you go.
Handle edge cases early in the code (e.g., empty lists, no solution).
Focus on clarity over brevity—comment if necessary.

10. Optimize the Solution
After your initial solution works:Consider if you can reduce time complexity by improving algorithms.
Can you use more efficient data structures?
Are there redundant operations that can be avoided?
Evaluate your solution's space complexity—could you reduce memory usage?

11. Test the Solution
Test with multiple test cases:Standard test cases from the problem statement.
Edge cases: empty input, one element, negative values, very large/small values, etc.
Verify correctness: Ensure the solution works for both typical and edge cases.

12. Analyze Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: Analyze the number of operations based on the size of input (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)).
Space Complexity: Analyze the memory used (e.g., O(n) for an array, O(1) for a constant space solution).
