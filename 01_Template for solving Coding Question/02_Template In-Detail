4.Input to Output conversion subtasks into Code:
4.1 Do every subtask in an Efficient manner.
- Find out what type of task you are going to do for example Searching, Sorting etc
- Find out what are the things available for the task for effieincy.
4.1.1 For Efficient Code:
- To ensure an efficient approach to coding tasks,
- it is essential to break down the problem into smaller subtasks and apply the best data Structure and algorithms suited for each type.

4.1.1.1.Task Type Identification:
First, you need to understand the nature of the problem or subtask.
Common task types include: (Searching, Sorting, Optimization (e.g., greedy algorithms, dynamic programming), Graph problems, Recursion or backtracking and
Other specific tasks (e.g., number theory, matrix problems))

4.1.1.2. Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures for Each Task
A. Searching
Linear Search: Useful for unsorted arrays or small datasets, but inefficient with large datasets (O(n) time complexity).
Binary Search: Efficient for sorted datasets (O(log n) time complexity). Use when the data is sorted or can be sorted.
Hash-based Search: Efficient for unordered data, O(1) average-case time complexity (e.g., hash maps, hash sets).
Search in Graphs (BFS, DFS): If searching in a graph, use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).

B. Sorting
Quick Sort: O(n log n) on average, suitable for most cases due to its efficiency in practice.
Merge Sort: O(n log n), stable, and works well for large datasets.
Heap Sort: O(n log n), especially useful for problems involving priority queues.
Radix Sort: O(nk), where k is the number of digits/characters (useful for sorting large numbers or strings).
Insertion Sort / Bubble Sort: O(n²), not efficient for large datasets but can be used for small or nearly sorted data.

C. Optimization Problems
Greedy Algorithms:
Used to solve problems that can be solved by choosing the locally optimal solution at each step, aiming for global optimization.
Examples: Huffman coding, Activity selection problem, Kruskal’s/Prim’s algorithm for MST.

Dynamic Programming (DP):
Memoization (Top-Down DP):
Store the result of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations (avoids recomputation).
Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP):
Solve the problem iteratively using a table to store subproblem solutions.
Examples: Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Matrix Chain Multiplication, Fibonacci sequence.

D. Graph Problems
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Best for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
Depth-First Search (DFS):Useful for exploring all possible paths or detecting cycles in a graph.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Efficient for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs (O(V log V + E)).
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Used for graphs with negative weight edges, but slower than Dijkstra’s (O(VE)).
Floyd-Warshall: For all-pairs shortest path in dense graphs (O(V³)).
A Search: A heuristic-based algorithm for pathfinding, used in AI applications.
Topological Sorting: Used for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), particularly for scheduling tasks or dependency resolution.

E. Recursion or Backtracking
Divide and Conquer:
Breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their results.
Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.

Backtracking:
A trial-and-error approach where you build a solution incrementally, and if it fails, you backtrack and try different options.
Examples: N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver, Permutations/Combinations.

Memoization: Top-Down approach for optimizing recursive solutions by storing previously computed results (overlapping subproblems).
Dynamic Programming: Bottom-Up approach for problems that involve overlapping subproblems, ensuring solutions are computed once.

F. Other Specific Problems
Mathematical/Number Theory Problems:

Prime Number Algorithms: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes (O(n log log n)) for finding all primes up to a given number.
GCD / LCM: Use the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) efficiently (O(log min(a, b))).
Modular Arithmetic: For problems involving large numbers, apply modular arithmetic techniques like Exponentiation by Squaring (O(log n)).
Number Theory DP: For counting partitions, coin change, etc

Matrix Problems:
Matrix Multiplication: Standard matrix multiplication is O(n³), but Strassen’s Algorithm reduces it to O(n².81).
Dynamic Programming on Matrices: Apply DP for problems like Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) or Matrix Chain Multiplication.

3. Key Data Structures for Efficiency
Arrays and Lists: Efficient for indexing and sequential storage.
Hash Tables (HashMap, HashSet): Useful for fast search, insert, and delete operations (average O(1)).
Heaps (Priority Queues): Efficient for problems like finding the minimum/maximum element (O(log n) for insertion and deletion).
Linked Lists: Good for dynamic memory allocation and when insertion/deletion is frequent.
Trees:Binary Search Tree (BST): Allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion (O(log n) for balanced trees).
AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree: Balanced trees for ensuring O(log n) time complexity for search operations.
Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees): For efficient range queries and updates.
Trie (Prefix Tree): Excellent for problems involving string storage and retrieval.
Graphs:Adjacency Matrix: Efficient for dense graphs.
Adjacency List: Efficient for sparse graphs.

4. Complexity Considerations
To make your code efficient, always consider:
Time Complexity: Ensure your solution meets the required time complexity for the given input size.
Space Complexity: Consider if the space used (e.g., auxiliary data structures, recursion depth) is efficient for large inputs.
