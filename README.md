# DSA Interview Preparation

Welcome to my repository dedicated to preparing for coding interviews! Here, you'll find my solutions and resources to help master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which are key to acing technical interviews.

## üìö What‚Äôs Inside
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Hash Maps, etc.
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to common coding interview problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.

## üîß Tools and Platforms
- **LeetCode**: [Link to my LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/your-profile)
- **HackerRank**: [Link to my HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/your-profile)
- **Codeforces**: [Link to my Codeforces Profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/your-profile)

## üß© Problem Solving Approach
1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully and identify the requirements.
2. **Plan the Solution**: Think about the most efficient algorithm and the right data structure.
3. **Write the Code**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring clarity and correctness.
4. **Optimize**: Once the solution works, look for ways to improve time and space complexity.
5. **Test**: Always validate your solution with edge cases and large inputs.

## üöÄ Goals
- Master key DSA concepts.
- Improve speed and accuracy in solving coding problems.
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews.
