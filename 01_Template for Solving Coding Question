Here's a versatile template for solving any Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem.
You can follow this structured approach to break down and solve a problem methodically:

DSA Problem-Solving Template.

--> Understanding the problem statement 
--> Extracting Imformation from the problem statement 
--> Thinking Solution in conversional manner 
--> converting the conversional solution into subtasks 
--> converting the conversional subtasks into code.

1.Understanding the Problem Statement: 
  - Understand the Problem Statement
  - What is being asked?: Carefully read the description to identify the problem's objective.

2.Extracting Information from the Problem Statement:
  - Input data type - with this we can know about the function arguments.
  - Expected Output - Understand what output is expected.
  - Output return type - with this we understand what to return from the function.
  - Understanding Time complexity expectations if any in the given problem statement -  
  - Understanding the Constraints - with this we can understand how much is the Input size that helps to thing how big the input

2.Extracting Information from the Problem Statement:
  - Input data type - 
  - Expected Output - 
  - Output return type - 
  - Understanding Time complexity expectations if any in the given problem statement -  
  - Understanding the Constraints -

3.Thinking Solution for the Problem Statement:
  3.1 Identification Part: Identify the Type of Problem - Recognize patterns
      - Searching (binary search, linear search)
      - Sorting (quick sort, merge sort)
      - Greedy algorithms (minimizing/maximizing)
      - Dynamic programming (overlapping subproblems, memoization)
      - Graph problems (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
      - Recursion or backtracking (divide and conquer)

  3.2 Destructuring:
  - Destructure the given problem statement into simple words to get the intuition for conversational solution by asking how.

  3.3 Conversional solution into smaller subtask :
  - After Finding out Solution in conversational manner and than breaking the conversional solution into smaller subtask 
     and then ask how I can achieve these conversional Solution Steps.

  - Complete all the smaller subtask and Combine all the Subtask into solution.

4.Conversional Solution into Code:
  - Choose the Right Data Structures.
  - Design the Algorithm with respect to Edge Cases
     - Consider cases where the input is
       for Example
       - Empty arrays, lists, or strings.
       - Arrays with only one element.
       - Arrays where no solution exists.
       - Negative numbers, zeros, very large or very small numbers.
       - Explicitly test and handle these cases in your solution.
         The above are some example

    - After converting the conversional solution into Subtasks and now we have to convert subtasks into code in java.
    - Combine all the smaller Subproblems code for the Complete Solution.
